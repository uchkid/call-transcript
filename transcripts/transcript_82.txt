Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent bill for a doctor's visit. I was charged a copay of $50, but my policy says I shouldn't have to pay anything for this type of service.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, MEM123456. Can you please confirm your name and date of birth so I can look into this further for you?

Member: My name is Emily Wilson and my date of birth is March 12, 1985.

Customer Support: Thank you, Emily. I've located your account. Can you please tell me the date of the doctor's visit and the name of the doctor or medical group you visited?

Member: It was on January 20th and the doctor's name is Dr. Smith.

Customer Support: Okay, I've found the claim. I'm going to go ahead and review the details. (pause) Ah, I see the issue. It looks like there was an error on our part. Your policy does indeed cover this service with a $0 copay.

Member: That's what I thought! I was surprised to see the charge on my bill.

Customer Support: I apologize for the mistake, Emily. I'm going to go ahead and process a refund for the $50 copay. You should receive the refund within the next 7-10 business days.

Member: That's great, thank you so much for your help!

Customer Support: You're welcome, Emily. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again for resolving the issue.

Customer Support: You're welcome. Have a great day and thank you for choosing our insurance company.
