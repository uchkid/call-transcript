Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent visit to the doctor's office. I was charged a copay of $50, but I thought my policy had a $20 copay for that service.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, MEM123456. Can you please confirm your name and date of birth so I can look into this further?

Member: My name is Emily Wilson, and my date of birth is March 12, 1985.

Customer Support: Thank you, Emily. I've located your account. Can you please provide me with the date of service and the name of the doctor's office you visited?

Member: It was on January 10th, and the doctor's office was Smith Medical Group.

Customer Support: Okay, I've found the claim. I'm going to review the details. (pause) It looks like the copay for this service is indeed $20, according to your policy. I apologize for the mistake.

Member: So, what's going to happen now? Will I get a refund?

Customer Support: I'm going to go ahead and process a refund for the difference of $30. You should receive it within the next 7-10 business days. Additionally, I'm going to send a notification to the doctor's office to correct their records.

Member: That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Emily. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

Customer Support: You're welcome. Have a great day.

(pause)

Customer Support: Emily, I just wanted to confirm that I've also sent you a confirmation email with the details of the refund and the corrected copay amount.

Member: Okay, great. Thank you for letting me know.

Customer Support: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
