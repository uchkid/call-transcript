Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent doctor's visit. I was charged a $50 copay, but I'm pretty sure my policy says I shouldn't have to pay anything for that service. 

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, and I'd be happy to help you look into this. Can you please provide me with your member ID so I can access your account information?

Member: It's MEM123456.

Customer Support: Thank you, MEM123456. Can you please confirm your date of birth so I can verify your identity?

Member: It's 02/12/1990.

Customer Support: Great, thank you for confirming. I've accessed your account information. Can you please tell me more about the service you received and the date of the visit?

Member: It was on January 10th, and I had a follow-up appointment with my primary care physician.

Customer Support: Okay, I see the claim here. Let me just check the policy details real quick. (pause) Ah, I see that your policy does indeed cover this service with a $0 copay. I'm going to go ahead and investigate why you were charged $50.

Member: That sounds great, thank you. I appreciate it.

Customer Support: You're welcome. I'm going to go ahead and put you on a brief hold while I check with our claims department. (hold music plays for 2 minutes)

Customer Support: Hi again, MEM123456. I've spoken with our claims department, and it appears that there was an error on our part. We're going to go ahead and reprocess the claim with the correct copay amount.

Member: That sounds great, thank you so much. How long will it take to get the refund?

Customer Support: The refund will be processed within the next 7-10 business days. You'll receive a notification once it's been processed. However, I do want to let you know that we may need to request additional information from your physician's office to complete the reprocessing.

Member: Okay, that sounds fine. Can you keep me updated on the status?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'll make sure to add a note to your account to follow up with you in a few days to check on the status of the reprocessing. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you so much for your help.

Customer Support: You're welcome, MEM123456. We apologize again for the mistake and appreciate your patience. Have a great day.

Member: You too, thank you.

 Customer Support: Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. But can you tell me when this issue will be resolved?

Customer Support: As I mentioned earlier, the refund will be processed within 7-10 business days. However, the issue may take a bit longer to be fully resolved, as we may need to request additional information from your physician's office. 

Member: Okay, so it's not resolved yet?

Customer Support: That's correct. We'll be following up with you in the next few days to check on the status of the reprocessing.
