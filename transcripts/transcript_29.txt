Member: Hello, I'm calling about a denied claim I received for a recent medical service. I believe it was incorrectly denied as my new policy should cover it. My member ID is MEM123456.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, and I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you please provide me with the claim number so I can look into this further?

Member: It's claim number #CLM789012.

Customer Support: Thank you. I've located the claim. Can you please tell me more about the service that was denied and why you believe it should be covered under your new policy?

Member: The service was for a physical therapy session, and I had recently switched to a new policy that includes coverage for physical therapy. However, the denial letter stated that my policy doesn't cover this service.

Customer Support: I understand. I'm going to check on the status of your policy update in our system. (pause) I apologize for the delay. It seems that your new policy hasn't been updated in our system yet, which is why the claim was denied.

Member: Okay, thank you.

Customer Support: You're welcome. I've transferred the call. Our policy update team will assist you further. (pause) Ah, I'm back on the line. The policy update team has updated your information, and your new policy is now reflected in our system.

Member: Great, thank you! What's the status of my claim now?
