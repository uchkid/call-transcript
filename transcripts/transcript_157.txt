Member: Hi, I'm calling to get a case pre-authorized. My name is Emily Wilson and my member ID is MEM123456.

PA Agent: Hi Emily, thank you for calling PA customer care. Can you please confirm your date of birth for verification purposes?

Member: It's March 12, 1985.

PA Agent: Thank you, Emily. Can you please tell me a little bit about the case you're seeking pre-authorization for? What's the procedure or treatment you're looking to have done?

Member: I'm scheduled to have a knee arthroscopy next week and I want to make sure it's covered.

PA Agent: Okay, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you please provide me with the name of your doctor and the facility where the procedure is scheduled to take place?

Member: My doctor's name is Dr. Smith and the facility is Springdale Hospital.

PA Agent: Great, thank you for that information. Can you please hold for just a moment while I check on the eligibility of your coverage?

Member: Sure, no problem.

PA Agent: Okay, Emily, I've checked on your coverage and it looks like you do have coverage for the procedure. However, I do need to advise you that there is a deductible that will need to be met before coverage kicks in.

Member: Okay, that's fine. How much is the deductible?

PA Agent: Your deductible is $500. But don't worry, once that's met, your coverage will kick in and you'll only be responsible for a small copay.

Member: That sounds good. So, is the case pre-authorized?

PA Agent: Yes, Emily, the case is pre-authorized. I've gone ahead and processed the pre-authorization and you should receive a confirmation letter in the mail within the next few days.

Member: Great, thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.

PA Agent: You're welcome, Emily. It was my pleasure to assist you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

PA Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day and take care of that knee!

Member: You too, thank you. Bye.

PA Agent: Bye, Emily.
