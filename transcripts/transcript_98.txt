Member: Hi, I'm calling about a denied claim I received for a recent medical service. I believe it was denied in error. My member ID is MEM123456. 
Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, MEM123456. Can you please provide me with the claim number so I can look into this further for you? 
Member: It's claim number CLM789012. 
Customer Support: Thank you. I've located the claim. It appears the denial was due to the service not being covered under your policy at the time. 
Member: That's what the letter said, but I had switched to a new policy before I received the service, and I'm certain it's covered under the new policy. 
Customer Support: I understand your concern. Let me check on the status of your policy change. (pause) It looks like your new policy information hasn't been updated in our system yet. This would explain why the claim was denied under the old policy. 
Member: Okay, that makes sense. But what can we do about the claim now? 
Customer Support: I'm going to go ahead and escalate this to our claims investigation team. They'll review the claim under your new policy, and we should be able to get it approved for you. 
Member: That sounds great. How long will it take for them to review it? 
Customer Support: Typically, it takes about 3 to 5 business days for the review and processing. You'll receive a new notification once the claim has been reprocessed. 
Member: Alright, that sounds good. And just to confirm, you've noted that the issue was due to the policy not being updated in your system? 
Customer Support: Exactly. We've documented the reason for the denial and the steps we're taking to correct it. 
Member: Okay, thank you for your help in resolving this. 
Customer Support: You're welcome, MEM123456. We apologize again for the mistake and appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? 
Member: No, that's all. Thank you. 
Customer Support: Great. Have a good day, and we'll be in touch once the claim is reprocessed.
