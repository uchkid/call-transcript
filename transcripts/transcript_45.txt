Member: Hi, I'm calling about a denied claim. My name is Emily Wilson, and my member ID is MEM456789.

Customer Support: I'm happy to help you with that, Emily. Can you please tell me more about the denied claim and the services that were not covered?

Member: Yes, of course. I recently switched to a new policy, but the claim for my physical therapy sessions was denied, saying that the service is not covered under my policy. However, I've reviewed my new policy, and it clearly states that physical therapy is covered.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, Emily. Can you please confirm your new policy effective date and the date of the physical therapy sessions?

Member: The new policy effective date is March 1st, and the physical therapy sessions took place in April.

Customer Support: Thank you for providing that information. I'm going to check on the status of your policy update in our system. (pause) It looks like there's been an issue with updating your new policy in our system, which is why the claim was denied. I'm going to escalate this to our dedicated team to get your claims approved.

Member: Oh, I see. So, it was just a technical issue?

Customer Support: Exactly. We'll get this corrected, and I'll make sure your claims are processed as soon as possible.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. Can you give me an estimated timeframe for when this will be resolved?

Customer Support: I've escalated the issue, and I expect it to be resolved within the next 24 to 48 hours. You will receive an update on your claim status via email.
