Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent doctor's visit. I was charged a copay of $50, but I thought my policy didn't have a copay for that service.

Customer Support: I'd be happy to help you with that, can you please provide me with your member ID so I can look into this further?

Member: My member ID is MEM123456.

Customer Support: Thank you, Ms... (checking the name) ...Johnson. I've located your account. Can you please tell me more about the service you received and the date of the visit?

Member: It was on February 10th, and I had a follow-up appointment with my primary care physician.

Customer Support: Okay, let me check on that. (pause) I see that you did have a visit on February 10th, and according to our records, you should have had a $0 copay for that service.

Member: Exactly! That's what I thought. So, why was I charged $50?

Customer Support: I apologize for the mistake, Ms. Johnson. It looks like there was an error on our part when processing the claim. I'm going to go ahead and correct this for you.

Member: That's great, thank you so much! How long will it take to correct this?

Customer Support: It should be corrected within the next 24-48 hours. You should receive a refund for the incorrect copay amount.

Member: Wonderful! I appreciate your help with this. Can you also confirm that my policy still has the $0 copay for that service?

Customer Support: Yes, I've verified that your policy still has the $0 copay for that service. You shouldn't have any issues with future visits.

Member: Great, thank you again for your assistance!

Customer Support: You're welcome, Ms. Johnson. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you!

Customer Support: You're welcome! Have a great day!
