Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent bill for a doctor's visit. I was charged a $50 copay, but I'm pretty sure my policy says I only have to pay $20 for that service.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you please provide me with your member ID so I can look into this further?

Member: It's MEM123456.

Customer Support: Thank you, Mr./Ms./Mrs./Dr./Prof. (Title) Last Name. I'm going to check on the copay for that service. Can you please hold for just a moment?

Member: (pause) Yeah, sure.

Customer Support: Thank you for holding. I've checked on the copay, and it looks like our records show that the $50 copay is correct. However, I'd like to investigate further to ensure that this is accurate.

Member: But I'm positive my policy says $20. I've been with this insurance company for years, and I've never paid more than that for a doctor's visit.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Can you please tell me more about your policy, such as when you enrolled and what type of plan you have?

Member: I enrolled in 2018, and I have a silver plan.

Customer Support: Okay, thank you for that information. I'm going to check on some additional details. (pause) I apologize, but it's going to take me a few more minutes to investigate this further. Can you please hold?

Member: (sighs) Fine.

Customer Support: Thank you for holding. I've checked on the policy details, and it appears that there was an error on our part. You are correct that your copay for that service should be $20. I'm going to go ahead and process a refund for the difference.

Member: Finally. It's about time someone listened to me.

Customer Support: I apologize again for the mistake and any frustration it may have caused. You should receive the refund within the next 7-10 business days. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's it. Thanks for fixing the problem.

Customer Support: You're welcome, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Have a good day.

Member: Yeah.

Customer Support: Thank you for calling, and we appreciate your business.

Member: (hangs up)
