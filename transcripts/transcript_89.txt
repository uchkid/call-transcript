PA Agent: (after a brief hold) Okay, Emily, I've checked on your benefits, and it looks like you have coverage for the procedure. However, I need to verify a few more details. Can you please tell me the diagnosis code and the CPT code for the procedure?

PA Agent: Alright, thank you for providing that information. I'm going to go ahead and process the pre-authorization request. (pause) Okay, Emily, I've submitted the request, but I need to let you know that we require additional information from your doctor's office to complete the review.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. What information do they need to provide?

PA Agent: We need a detailed letter of medical necessity from your doctor explaining why this procedure is necessary. We also need a copy of your medical records and a breakdown of the costs associated with the procedure.
