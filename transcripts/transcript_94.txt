Member: Hi, I'm calling to get a case pre-authorized for a medical procedure. My name is Emily Wilson, and my member ID is MEM456789.

PA Agent: Thank you for calling, Emily. Can you please confirm your date of birth for verification purposes?

Member: It's March 12, 1985.

PA Agent: Thank you, Emily. Can you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you need pre-authorization for? What is the procedure, and when is it scheduled?

Member: It's a knee replacement surgery, and it's scheduled for April 15th.

PA Agent: Okay, got it. And which doctor or hospital will be performing the procedure?

Member: Dr. John Smith at Mercy Hospital.

PA Agent: Alright. I'm checking your eligibility for the procedure... (pause) Yes, it looks like you are eligible for the procedure. However, I need to check a few more things before I can give you a decision.

Member: Okay, no problem.

PA Agent: Can you please hold for just a minute while I check on some additional information?

Member: Sure.

PA Agent: (after a brief hold) Okay, Emily, I've checked on everything, and it looks like we can approve the pre-authorization for your knee replacement surgery. However, I do need to inform you that there will be a $500 copay due at the time of the procedure.

Member: That's fine. How do I get the pre-authorization number?

PA Agent: I'll go ahead and generate the pre-authorization number now. Your pre-authorization number is PA001234. You can provide this number to your doctor's office or the hospital, and they will be able to verify the pre-authorization.

Member: Great, thank you so much for your help!

PA Agent: You're welcome, Emily. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

PA Agent: You're welcome. Have a great day, and I hope your surgery goes well.
