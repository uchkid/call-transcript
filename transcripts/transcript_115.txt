Member: Hi, my name is Emily Wilson and my member ID is MEM456789. I'm calling about a claim that was denied. I received a letter stating that my policy doesn't cover the service, but I'm certain that it should be covered under my new policy.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, Emily. Can you please provide me with more information about the claim and the service that was denied?

Member: Yes, of course. The claim was for a dental procedure that I had last month. I had switched to a new policy in January, and according to the policy documents, this type of procedure should be covered.

Customer Support: I understand. Can you please hold for just a moment while I check on the status of your claim?

 Member: Sure, thank you.

Customer Support: Emily, I've checked on the status of your claim, and it appears that our system still has your old policy information on file. It looks like the update to your new policy hasn't been processed yet.

Member: That makes sense. I did switch policies recently. Can you please update the system and reprocess the claim?

Customer Support: I'd be happy to help you with that, Emily. However, I need to escalate this issue to our claims team to get the claim reprocessed. They will review the information and get back to you within the next 24-48 hours.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. Can you please give me a reference number or something so I can follow up on the status of the claim?

Customer Support: Yes, of course. Your reference number is #CAS-012345. You can use this number to track the status of your claim. We'll also send you a follow-up email with the updated information.

Member: Great, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Emily. I apologize again for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience. We'll get this resolved for you as soon as possible.

Member: Thank you again. I'll wait to hear back from the claims team.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Emily. Have a great day!
