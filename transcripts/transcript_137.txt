Customer Support: I'd be happy to help you, MEM123456. Can you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing? Are you getting an error message when you try to log in?

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience. Can you try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, and then attempt to log in again?

Member: Okay, let me try that. (pause) I've cleared the cache and cookies, but I'm still getting the same error message.

Customer Support: Okay, no problem. Can you try resetting your password? Sometimes, passwords can get locked out due to too many incorrect login attempts.

Member: That's a good idea. I'll try resetting my password now. (pause) Okay, I've reset my password, but I'm still having trouble logging in.
