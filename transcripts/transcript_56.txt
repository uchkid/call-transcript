Member: Hi, I'm calling to get a case pre-authorized. My name is Emily Wilson and my member ID is MEM123456.

PA Agent: Thank you for calling PA customer care, Emily. Can you please confirm your date of birth for verification purposes?

Member: It's March 12, 1985.

PA Agent: Thank you, Emily. Can you please provide me with the details of the case you'd like to get pre-authorized? What's the procedure or service you're seeking pre-authorization for?

Member: I'm looking to get a knee replacement surgery. My doctor has recommended it and I'd like to get it pre-authorized before scheduling the surgery.

PA Agent: Okay, Emily. Can you please provide me with your doctor's name and the name of the hospital where the surgery will take place?

Member: My doctor's name is Dr. Smith and the hospital is Mercy General Hospital.

PA Agent: Thank you, Emily. I'm checking on your eligibility for the procedure... (pause) Okay, it looks like you have coverage for the procedure. However, I do need to inform you that there may be some out-of-pocket costs associated with the surgery.

Member: Okay, that's fine. Can you please let me know what the estimated out-of-pocket costs are?

PA Agent: Let me check on that for you... (pause) Okay, it looks like your estimated out-of-pocket costs will be around $1,000.

Member: Okay, that sounds reasonable. What's the next step in the pre-authorization process?

PA Agent: I'm going to go ahead and process the pre-authorization request. However, I do need to inform you that we'll need to review some additional information before we can provide a final decision. We'll need to review your medical records and get more information from your doctor.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. How long will it take to get a final decision?

PA Agent: We'll typically provide a decision within 3-5 business days. We'll contact you and your doctor's office once a decision has been made.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. Is there anything else I need to do in the meantime?

PA Agent: No, Emily, that's all for now. We'll be in touch soon with an update on your pre-authorization request.

Member: Okay, thank you for your help.
