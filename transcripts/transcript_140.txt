Member: Hi, I'm calling to schedule an appointment with a specialist. My name is Emily Wilson, and my member ID is MEM123456.

Customer Support: Hi Emily, thank you for calling. Can you please confirm your date of birth and the type of specialist you're looking to see?

Member: My date of birth is March 12, 1985, and I'm looking to see a cardiologist.

Customer Support: Okay, thank you for that information, Emily. Let me check the availability of our cardiologists. (pause) It looks like Dr. Smith has an opening on Thursday at 2 PM. Would that work for you?

Member: That's a bit too early for me. Do you have anything later in the day?

Customer Support: Let me check. (pause) Yes, Dr. Johnson has an opening at 4 PM on Thursday. Would you like to schedule with her?
