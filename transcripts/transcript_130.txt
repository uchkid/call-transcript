Member: Hi, I'm calling about a denied claim I received for a recent medical service. My claim was denied because the policy doesn't cover the service, but I'm certain I switched to a new policy that does cover it. My member ID is MEM123456.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Johnson. Can you please confirm the date of the service and the reason for the denial?

Member: Yes, the service was on January 10th, and the denial reason is "policy does not cover the service". But like I said, I've switched to a new policy that started on January 1st, and I'm sure this service is covered under the new policy.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, Mr. Johnson. Let me check on this for you. Can you please hold for just a moment?

Customer Support: Mr. Johnson, I've checked on your account, and it appears that your new policy has not been updated in our system. This is likely the reason for the denial. I'm going to go ahead and connect you with our updates team to get this corrected.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate your help with this.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. I'm going to transfer you now. Please hold for just a moment.

Customer Support: Mr. Johnson, I've spoken with the updates team, and they're going to go ahead and update your policy in our system. Once that's done, they'll resubmit your claim for processing. You should receive a new determination letter within the next 7-10 business days.

Member: That sounds great, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Have a great day.

 Member: You too, bye.

Customer Support: Bye.
