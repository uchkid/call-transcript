Customer Support: Hi Emily, thank you for calling. I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment. Can you please tell me what type of specialist you're looking for and what's the reason for your visit?

Member: I'm looking for a dermatologist. I've been having some skin issues and I'd like to get it checked out.

Customer Support: I understand. Let me check the availability of our dermatologists. (pause) Okay, I have a few options available. We have Dr. Smith available on Wednesday at 2 PM or Dr. Johnson available on Friday at 10 AM. Both are highly rated and have great reviews. Which one would you prefer?

Member: That's great, thank you! I think I'd like to schedule with Dr. Johnson on Friday at 10 AM.
