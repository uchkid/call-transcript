Member: Hi, I'm calling about a claim that was denied. I received a letter saying it was because my policy doesn't cover the service, but I had switched to a new policy that does cover it. My member ID is MEM123456. 

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Johnson. Can you please confirm your date of birth and the date of service so I can look into this further?

Member: My date of birth is 02/12/1985, and the date of service was 03/10/2023.

Customer Support: Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I've located your account. It appears that your new policy information hasn't been updated in our system yet. This is likely why your claim was denied.

Member: That makes sense, I guess. I did switch policies about a month ago. Is there anything that can be done to fix this?

Customer Support: Absolutely, Mr. Johnson. I'm going to go ahead and connect you with our updates team to get your policy information updated in the system. Once that's done, I'll have them re-process your claim.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. How long will that take?

Customer Support: It should only take a few minutes. I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I connect with the updates team.

Member: Alright, thank you.

Customer Support: Thank you for holding, Mr. Johnson. I've spoken with the updates team, and they've updated your policy information in the system. They're going to go ahead and re-process your claim, and you should receive an update within the next 24 hours.

Member: Great, thank you so much for your help.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

Customer Support: You're welcome. Have a great day, Mr. Johnson.
