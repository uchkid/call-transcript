Member: Hi, I'm calling about a denied claim I received for my recent medical service. I was told that my policy doesn't cover it, but I'm certain it should be covered under my new policy. My member ID is MEM123456.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, MEM123456. Can you please provide me with more information about the denied claim, such as the claim number and the date of service?

Member: The claim number is CLM789012, and the date of service was February 10th.

Customer Support: Thank you for providing that information. I've located your claim in our system. Can you tell me more about the new policy you're referring to? When did you switch policies?

Member: I switched policies on January 1st. I was told that the new policy would cover the service I received, but the denial letter says it's not covered.

Customer Support: I understand your concern. Let me check on the status of your policy update in our system. (pause) I apologize, but it appears that your new policy has not been updated in our system. This is likely the reason why your claim was denied.

Member: That's frustrating. How can we get this resolved?

Customer Support: I'm going to go ahead and connect you with our policy update team. They'll be able to assist in updating your policy and reprocessing your claim. Please hold for just a moment.
