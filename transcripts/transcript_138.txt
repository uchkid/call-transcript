PA Agent: Great, thank you. I'm going to go ahead and check on your eligibility for this procedure. Can you please hold for just a moment?

Member: Sure, go ahead.

PA Agent: Okay, I've checked on your eligibility and it looks like you have coverage for this procedure. However, I do need to verify a few more details. Can you please confirm your primary care physician's name and your current address?
