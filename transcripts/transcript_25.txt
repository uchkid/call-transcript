Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent visit to the doctor's office. I was charged a copay of $50 for a service, but I'm pretty sure my policy doesn't require a copay for that service.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, can you please provide me with your member ID so I can look into this further?

Member: It's MEM123456.

Customer Support: Thank you, let me just verify some information. Can you please confirm your name and date of birth?

Member: My name is Emily Wilson and my date of birth is March 12, 1985.

Customer Support: Thank you, Emily. I've located your account. Can you please tell me more about the service you received and the date of the visit?

Member: It was on February 20th and I had a follow-up appointment with my primary care physician.

Customer Support: I see. I'm going to check on the copay amount for that service. Can you please hold for just a moment?

Member: Okay, sure.

Customer Support: Thank you for holding, Emily. I've checked on the copay amount and it appears that there was an error in the billing. Your policy does indeed have a $0 copay for that service.

Member: That's what I thought. So, what's going to happen next?

Customer Support: We're going to go ahead and process a refund for the $50 copay amount. You should see the credit on your next statement.

Member: Okay, that sounds great. How long will it take for the refund to be processed?

Customer Support: It usually takes 7-10 business days for the refund to be processed. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Member: Alright, thank you for your help in resolving this issue.

Customer Support: You're welcome, Emily. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Member: No, that's all. Thank you again.

Customer Support: You're welcome. Have a great day.

Customer Support: Emily, just to confirm, I've processed the refund and you should receive the credit on your next statement. The amount of $50 will be refunded to you.

Customer Support: Bye.
