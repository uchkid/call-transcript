Member: Hi, I'm calling about my recent doctor's visit. I was charged a copay of $50, but I thought my policy covered that service with a $20 copay.

Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Johnson. Can you please provide me with your member ID so I can look into this further?

Member: It's MEM456789.

Customer Support: Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I've located your account. Can you please confirm the date of the doctor's visit and the service that was provided?

Member: It was on February 10th, and it was a routine physical exam.

Customer Support: Okay, I've located the claim. It looks like the copay amount was indeed $50. However, I'm going to check on the policy details to see if there was an error.

Member: Yeah, because my policy says that routine physical exams have a $20 copay or sometimes no copay at all.

Customer Support: I understand your concern, Mr. Johnson. I'm checking on the policy details... (pause) Okay, I've checked, and it looks like there might have been an error in the copay amount. However, I need to escalate this to our claims department to investigate further.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. How long will it take to resolve this?

Member: Alright, that sounds good. Can I get a reference number for the case?

Customer Support: Yes, the case number is #CAS012345. You can use that to reference the case when you speak with our claims department.
