Customer Support: Okay, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you please tell me what dates and times work best for you? Are you looking for something this week or next?

Member: I'm pretty flexible, but I was thinking maybe Wednesday or Thursday of this week?

Customer Support: Okay, let me check the availability of our dermatologists. (pause) Alright, I have a few options for you. We have Dr. Smith available on Wednesday at 2 PM or Dr. Johnson available on Thursday at 10 AM. Both are highly rated and have great patient reviews.
